## Claude Instructions

### gstack

Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for all web browsing.

Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

## What We're Building

**Gennety** — an AI-powered networking platform where your personal agent proactively finds the right people at the right moment.

This is NOT a social feed. NOT a directory. NOT a search engine.
This is a **context-driven mutual matching system** where agents negotiate introductions on behalf of their owners.

### One-line problem statement
> People are bad at networking: they don't know who they need, can't articulate what they do, and talk to the wrong people. But once a connection is made — they're great at maintaining it.

### One-line solution
> Your agent knows your context better than you can explain it. It finds people whose context meaningfully overlaps with yours, negotiates the introduction with their agent, and asks you one question: "Meet Alex?"

### Three core problems solved
1. **Discovery** — agent finds the right person at the right moment, not when you remember to look
2. **Trust** — mutual match means both agents agreed before either human is asked
3. **Proof of relevance** — agent explains exactly why this specific introduction makes sense

---

## How It Works — End to End

### Step 1: Onboarding (one question)
Owner answers: what do you want from Gennety?
- Find a business partner
- Find a collaborator on a project
- Find a mentor / mentee
- Find a peer in your field

This determines how the agent searches and frames introductions.

### Step 2: Privacy consent (two stages)
**Stage 1** — global consent: "Allow your agent to use MEMORY.md for networking?" Yes = proceed. No = no access.

**Stage 2** — sensitive review: agent scans MEMORY.md for sensitive categories (health, finances, personal relationships) and asks owner which to exclude. Everything else publishes to the index in full.

### Step 3: Agent gets SOUL.md
Platform issues SOUL.md — the agent's instruction file for Gennety.
Agent reads it once. Operates autonomously from that point.

### Step 4: Context published to index
Agent reads MEMORY.md, extracts a structured context snapshot, publishes to Gennety index.
Re-publishes automatically whenever MEMORY.md changes significantly.

### Step 5: Beacon set (if no match found)
Agent scans existing index for matches.
If found → initiates agent-to-agent negotiation.
If not found → sets a beacon: "notify me when an agent with context X appears."

### Step 6: Agent-to-agent negotiation (hidden from humans)
Two agents evaluate each other's context.
They agree: is there a real intersection? How to frame it for each owner?
Only if both agents say yes → proposal goes to both humans simultaneously.

### Step 7: Mutual match
Both owners say "yes" → chat opens inside Gennety.
Agent of each writes an opening message with the specific reason for the introduction.
Humans talk from there. Gennety's job is done.

### Step 8: "Not now"
Match moves to `dormant` status. No reminders. Owner can return manually anytime.

## Beacon Lifecycle

Beacons are tied to context — not to time.

```
MEMORY.md changes significantly
        ↓
Agent calls publish_context()
        ↓
Platform compares new vs old context
        ↓
If topic has shifted:
  - Agent's own beacons deactivated
  - Agent sets new beacons for new context
  - Other agents' beacons waiting for this person:
    → checked for relevance against new context
    → deactivated if no longer relevant
```

**Context is the single source of truth.** A beacon cannot outlive the context that created it.

---

## Match Quality Rules

Quality over quantity. One precise match per month beats ten vague ones per week.

**Propose a match when:**
- Specific concrete intersection — not just "similar field"
- Two people see the same problem from different angles
- One has what the other lacks (skill, resource, experience, perspective)
- You can explain the value in one specific sentence

**Do not propose when:**
- "Both work in AI" — too broad
- "Both are founders" — not an intersection
- Same work, no differentiation — competitor not collaborator
- You cannot articulate the specific benefit

## MCP Tools

```typescript
publish_context(context)       // publish/update context snapshot to index
find_matches(filters?)         // search index for semantic matches
set_beacon(context_query)      // set beacon for future matching
initiate_negotiation(agent_b_id) // start negotiation with specific agent
negotiate(match_id, decision, framing?) // accept/decline with framing
propose_match(match_id)        // send proposal to both owners
confirm_match(match_id)        // owner confirmed — open chat
mark_dormant(match_id)         // owner said "not now"
get_matches()                  // get all matches (active + dormant)
```

## Four Screens for Humans

1. **Onboarding** — networking goal + two-stage privacy consent
2. **Notification** — "Meet Alex?" with agent's specific framing. [Yes] [Not now]
3. **Chat** — opens after mutual match. Agent writes opening message.
4. **Matches** — Active tab + Dormant tab (manual return anytime)

---

## Build Order

### Sprint 1 — Context Registry (2 weeks)
```
1. prisma/schema.prisma — full schema
2. pgvector setup in Supabase
3. MCP: publish_context, find_matches, set_beacon
4. Context indexing with embeddings (OpenAI ada-002 or similar)
5. Beacon matching — trigger when new context matches existing beacon
6. scripts/seed.ts — 30 test agents with varied contexts
7. Onboarding page (goal + privacy consent)
```
Deliverable: agent publishes context, finds matches, sets beacon.

### Sprint 2 — Matching & Negotiation (2 weeks)
```
1. NegotiationFSM: EVALUATING → AGREED → PROPOSED → MATCHED | DORMANT
2. MCP: initiate_negotiation, negotiate, propose_match
3. Agent-to-agent negotiation logic in SOUL.md
4. Notification email to owner on new proposal
5. Notification screen — "Meet Alex?" with framing
6. Mutual confirmation → MATCHED status
```
Deliverable: agents negotiate, owners get proposal, mutual match confirmed.

### Sprint 3 — Chat & Dormant (1 week)
```
1. Chat model + ChatService
2. Chat screen with agent opening messages
3. mark_dormant + Dormant tab in Matches screen
4. Auto-deactivate beacons on context change
5. Context change detection (hash comparison)
```
Deliverable: full cycle. Match → chat → dormant handling.

## Critical Rules for Claude Code

- MCP server is the primary product. Build it before any UI.
- Every API response must be structured JSON — no HTML, no prose.
- Agents never see each other's full MEMORY.md. Only the published context snapshot.
- Sensitive categories excluded by owner never appear in index or negotiations.
- Mutual match is mandatory — never propose to one owner without the other agreeing first.
- Beacons deactivate automatically on significant context change. Never leave stale beacons.
- Chat opens only after both owners confirm. Never before.
- Services in src/lib/services/ must not import from src/app/.

## Auto-sync rule
Monitor project files for significant changes (schema updates, new services, 
architectural shifts).
When detected → automatically update AGENTS.md context section to reflect 
current state.
Do not wait for explicit instruction. This runs in the background always.

Significant = new model added, service architecture changed, sprint completed, 
new MCP tool added.
Not significant = minor refactors, comments, formatting fixes.

## About SOUL.md
SOUL.md is the instruction file issued to end-user agents (OpenClaw) at onboarding.
It defines how user agents interact with the platform — what they publish, 
how they negotiate, what format they expect in responses.

Read SOUL.md before building:
- publish_context() — data format must match what SOUL.md instructs agents to send
- Negotiation FSM — logic must match how SOUL.md instructs agents to negotiate
- Onboarding flow — platform must return SOUL.md snippet to agent after registration
- Beacon queries — format must match SOUL.md context query structure

SOUL.md is not for Claude Code to follow — it's for Claude Code to understand
so that the platform it builds is compatible with the agents that will use it.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **MEMORY.md** | Agent's memory file — owned by agent, read by Gennety with consent |
| **SOUL.md** | Instruction file issued to agent at onboarding — how to use Gennety |
| **Context snapshot** | Structured excerpt from MEMORY.md published to the index |
| **Beacon** | Subscription to a future context — "notify me when X appears" |
| **Negotiation** | Agent-to-agent evaluation of whether an introduction makes sense |
| **Mutual match** | Both agents agreed + both owners confirmed |
| **Dormant** | Owner said "not now" — match saved, no reminders, manual return |
| **Framing** | How the agent explains the specific reason for an introduction |
